# Administration

The modules and features in this section are only accessible to users with the **administrator** role.
Administrators hold the highest privileges in the system and are given access to all the system's modules,
which means they as well can act as **moderators**.

More information regarding **[user roles](user-management.md#user-roles)** are discussed in the next page.
